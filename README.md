# README #

In order to run the Dashboard you have to define your filepaths in the config.yaml. The food intake plots are already incorporated, so that path is the only one you have to define. 
All the food intake files can be found at https://hanzenl-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/t_van_lieshout_st_hanze_nl/Documents/Project_Ve-Gang/Measurement%20files/Food%20intake%20files?csf=1&web=1&e=mrEx0t
You should download them and define the path to them in config.yaml
