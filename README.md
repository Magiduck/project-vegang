# README #

In order to run the Dashboard you have to define your filepaths in the config.yaml. The food intake plots are already incorporated, so that path is the only one you have to define. 

All the food intake files can be found at https://hanzenl-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/t_van_lieshout_st_hanze_nl/Documents/Project_Ve-Gang/Measurement%20files/Food%20intake%20files?csf=1&web=1&e=mrEx0t

You should download the files and define the path to them in config.yaml

A skeleton is added for different functionality locations. Please search for the docstrings that contain 'NOTE'. Some instructions are put there for merging the plots in the Dashboard. 

If you think you implemented your plots in the Dashboard, please message me (Kylie) so I can check your commit out and merge it in the master branch. Please never push from your own branch to the master branch!!
